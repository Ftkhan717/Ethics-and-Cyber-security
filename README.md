# Ethics-and-Cyber-security

## What is ETHICS?

 * Ethics relates to the branch of philosophy which relates to the study of values, principles, beliefs and norms.These are the things that shape our choices.
 * Ethics ask us: 
 * 1) how should we live? 
 * 2) what choices should we make? 
 * 3) what makes our lives worth living?
 * 4) So to answer these questions I would say that Ethics is at the centre of everyday choices. Everytime we make a choice we change the world. Whether you are making one choice or several choices, what's imporatnt is that you make decision that are good and right. Choices that you can justify or on ones you can be proud of.
 
 ## How can we incorporate ethics in the company?
 
 * Everyone has a responsibility for ethics in the workplace. You, the employees and as well as the company have to ensure that you are responsible for your behaviour and that You support others by creating a positive ethical workplace for everyone. You need to know, understand and comply with your code of conduct. Ask questiions and get the facts straight. Be aware of the behaviour of others that may be illegal or unethical. If needed you need to councel other employees when they are in danger of violating ethical codes. Do whatever you can to contribute to an environment that upholds the high ethical standards of your company. If you are a manager you should lead by example and make everyone understand the company's ethics codes and policies. It is your responsibility to maintain a safe environment where employees can talk about ethics issues without fear of reprisal.
 
 ## What is Cyber Security?
 
 * Cyber Security involves tecniques that help in securing various digital components, networks, data and computer system from unauthorized digital access. There are multiple ways to implement cyber security depending on the kind of network that you are connected to and the type of cyber attacks you are prone to so there are various cyber attacks that anyone could have been exposed to and they are:
 1) Malware attack
 2) phishing attack
 3) Man-in-the-moidle-attack
 4) Password Attack
 * To prevent future cyber attacks and sought to implement a few Cyber Security practices. So for this first you should install a Firewall. It filter the incoming and outgoing traffic from your device to safeguard your network.
 * Honey pots are used to attract attackers, these system passwords are made to look vulnerable in order to deceive attackers and this in turn defends the real system.
 * In addition to these she also decided to use alpha numeric passwords antivirus software and started avoidind mails from unknown senders.
 * Cyber Security is not confined just to individuals but also to public and private organization.
 
 ## How will you show Ethics and Security in the company?
 
 * Proper use of technology is really about responsibility and respect. When i am using the technology for the purpose it was inteneded I'll show respect for owner. If I am using something inappropriately or for personal use, I am not respecting the rights of the owner. Additionally, you dont show respect for privacy and confidentiality. Just because I can access information doesn't mean I should.
 * If I am breaking into an E-Mail(Electronic-Mail)or file is no different than breaking the lock on a door. It is still breaking an entering and any information obtained as a result is stolen and is a violation of an individual rights, privacy and confidentiality. Proper use of technology shows my respect for property. 
 * In the end I would say tampering with or changing electronic information is vandalism and shows disrespect for others' property.
